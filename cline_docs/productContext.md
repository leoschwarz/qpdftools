# QPDFTools Product Context

## Purpose
QPDFTools is a PDF manipulation application that provides users with a simple interface to perform common PDF operations such as compressing, splitting, merging, and rotating PDF files. The application is currently available for Linux platforms, and the goal is to extend its availability to Windows users.

## Target Users
- Desktop users who need to manipulate PDF files
- Users who prefer a simple, straightforward interface for PDF operations
- Both Linux and Windows users (after this implementation)

## User Experience
QPDFTools aims to provide a seamless experience for users across different platforms. The Windows version should maintain the same functionality and user interface as the Linux version, while adhering to Windows platform conventions for installation, dependency management, and resource handling.

## Problem Solving
This implementation solves the problem of platform limitation by extending QPDFTools to Windows users. It addresses the technical challenges of cross-platform development, including:
- Platform-specific build configurations
- External dependency management
- Resource handling differences
- Installation and packaging differences

By implementing Windows support, QPDFTools will reach a wider audience and provide a consistent PDF manipulation experience across different operating systems.

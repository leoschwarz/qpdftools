# resources/CMakeLists.txt Instructions

## Objective
Update the resources/CMakeLists.txt file to handle platform-specific configurations for Windows builds.

## Changes Required
1. Make ECM and KDE dependencies conditional for Linux only
2. Add conditional blocks for platform-specific resource handling

## Implementation Details
- Wrap Linux-specific code in conditional blocks
- Add Windows-specific resource configuration (comment only, as Windows resources are handled in src/CMakeLists.txt)

## Dependencies
- Main CMakeLists.txt
- src/CMakeLists.txt

## Expected Result
A modified resources/CMakeLists.txt file that supports both Linux and Windows builds.

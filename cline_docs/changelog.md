- Initial setup of CRCT system files for tracking the Windows build implementation
- Updated CMakeLists.txt with Windows-specific configuration and CPack support
- Updated src/CMakeLists.txt with Windows-specific build and installation rules
- Updated resources/CMakeLists.txt with platform-specific conditional blocks
- Created Windows resource directory (resources/windows)
- Created Windows resource file (app.rc)
- Created placeholder for Windows icon file (app.ico)
- Updated ExternalSoftware class with platform-specific path handling
- Updated Ghostscript and QPDF classes to use platform-specific paths
- Created dependencies directory structure for Windows builds
- Added README for dependencies

### Fixed
- Fixed GitHub Actions workflow by removing incorrect Qt module specifications that were causing build failures
- Fixed Windows build compatibility issue with Qt::ColorScheme by adding a fallback implementation for Qt 6.2.4
- Fixed Windows build failure in GitHub Actions by adding automatic generation of app.ico from SVG source
- Simplified GitHub Actions workflow by removing ImageMagick dependency and using pre-generated icon file

### Issues
- Identified issue with Windows build in GitHub Actions: windeployqt tool fails with "Unknown option 'no-angle'" error
- Fixed windeployqt error by explicitly removing the unsupported `--no-angle` option and adding a comment explaining the removal

## [Future Improvements]
- âœ… Replace the placeholder icon file with an actual ICO file (now pre-generated and committed to repository)
- Add more features to the build script as needed
- Improve CI/CD workflow with additional testing steps
- Test and refine the cross-compilation process

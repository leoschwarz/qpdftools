# QPDFTools Windows Build Implementation - Active Context

## Current Work Focus
Implementing Windows build support for QPDFTools - completed all implementation steps.

## Recent Decisions
- Created CRCT system files to track the implementation process
- Decided to follow the detailed plan in windows_build_plan.md
- Updated CMake configuration files to support Windows builds
- Created Windows resource directory and files
- Updated external tool handling classes for cross-platform compatibility
- Created dependencies directory structure for Windows builds
- Created build automation script for cross-platform builds
- Set up CI/CD for Windows builds using GitHub Actions

## Immediate Priorities
1. ✅ Update CMake configuration files
   - ✅ Modify main CMakeLists.txt
   - ✅ Update src/CMakeLists.txt
   - ✅ Update resources/CMakeLists.txt
2. ✅ Create Windows-specific resources
   - ✅ Create Windows resource directory
   - ✅ Create Windows resource file (app.rc)
   - ✅ Create Windows icon file placeholder
3. ✅ Update external tool handling for cross-platform compatibility
   - ✅ Update ExternalSoftware class to add platform-specific path handling
   - ✅ Implement platform-specific path handling in ExternalSoftware.cpp
   - ✅ Update Ghostscript and QPDF classes to use platform-specific paths
4. ✅ Create dependencies directory structure
   - ✅ Create directory structure for Windows dependencies
   - ✅ Add README for dependencies
5. ✅ Create build automation script
   - ✅ Create cross-platform build script (build.py)
   - ✅ Make the script executable
6. ✅ Set up CI/CD for Windows builds
   - ✅ Create GitHub Actions workflow for Windows builds

## Current State
The project has completed the implementation of Windows build support. All the required changes have been made to support Windows builds, including CMake configuration updates, Windows-specific resources, external tool handling updates, dependencies directory structure, build automation script, and CI/CD configuration.

## Next Steps
1. Test the Windows build process
2. Update the actual icon file (app.ico) from the SVG source
3. Consider adding more features to the build script as needed

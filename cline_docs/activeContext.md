## Current State
The project has completed the implementation of Windows build support. All the required changes have been made to support Windows builds, including CMake configuration updates, Windows-specific resources, external tool handling updates, dependencies directory structure, build automation script, and CI/CD configuration. The GitHub Actions workflow has been fixed to correctly specify Qt modules, and a comprehensive guide for cross-compiling from Linux to Windows has been created. Additionally, a compatibility fix for Qt::ColorScheme has been implemented to ensure the Windows build works correctly with Qt 6.2.4.

We've optimized the Windows build process by creating a bash script (`generate_ico.sh`) that generates the Windows icon file (app.ico) from the SVG source. This icon file is now pre-generated and committed to the repository, which simplifies the GitHub Actions workflow by removing the need to install ImageMagick and generate the icon during the build process. This reduces build dependencies and makes the build process more reliable.

We've fixed an issue with the Windows build in GitHub Actions where the build was failing with an error related to the windeployqt tool not recognizing the `--no-angle` option. This option appears to be invalid or deprecated in the version of Qt being used in the GitHub Actions workflow (Qt 6.2.4). We've explicitly removed this option from the src/CMakeLists.txt file and added a comment explaining the removal to ensure the build succeeds in GitHub Actions.

We've fixed a critical issue with the Windows build where the application was failing to start due to missing Qt6Core.dll. This was caused by improper deployment of Qt dependencies in the packaging process. We've made three key improvements:

1. Enhanced the build.py script to run windeployqt on the installed executable when creating a portable package, ensuring all Qt dependencies are included.
2. Modified src/CMakeLists.txt to run windeployqt during both the post-build step and the installation process, ensuring Qt DLLs are properly included in the package.
3. Updated the GitHub workflow to ensure the Qt bin directory is in the PATH when running the build and packaging commands, and set the Qt6_DIR environment variable for the build script to find windeployqt.

These changes ensure that all required Qt DLLs are properly included in both the installer and portable packages, fixing the "Qt6Core.dll not found" error.

We've now fixed another critical issue with the Windows build in GitHub Actions where the build was failing with a "FileNotFoundError" when trying to run windeployqt.exe. The issue was that the build.py script couldn't find the windeployqt executable in the expected location. We've made the following improvements:

1. Enhanced the build.py script to search for windeployqt.exe in multiple possible locations, including GitHub Actions-specific paths.
2. Added detailed error reporting and path debugging to help diagnose path-related issues.
3. Updated the GitHub Actions workflow to include diagnostic steps that verify the Qt installation paths and list the contents of the Qt bin directory.
4. Added support for an alternate path format (/Qt/6.2.4/msvc2019_64/bin) that appears in the GitHub Actions logs.

These changes make the build process more robust by improving the detection of the windeployqt tool, especially in the GitHub Actions environment where paths may differ from local development environments.

## Next Steps
1. ✅ Fix the windeployqt error with the `--no-angle` option in GitHub Actions
2. ✅ Fix the Linux build in GitHub Actions to use Qt6 instead of Qt5
3. ✅ Fix Windows build issue with missing Qt6Core.dll
4. ✅ Fix Windows build issue with windeployqt path detection in GitHub Actions
5. Test the Windows build process with the updated Qt dependency deployment
6. Test the Linux build process
7. ✅ Update the actual icon file (app.ico) from the SVG source (now pre-generated and committed to repository)
8. Consider adding more features to the build script as needed
9. Test the cross-compilation process using the provided guide

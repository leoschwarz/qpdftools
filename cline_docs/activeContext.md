# QPDFTools Windows Build Implementation - Active Context

## Current Work Focus
Fixing GitHub Actions Windows build issues and implementing cross-compilation from Linux to Windows.

## Recent Decisions
- Created CRCT system files to track the implementation process
- Decided to follow the detailed plan in windows_build_plan.md
- Updated CMake configuration files to support Windows builds
- Created Windows resource directory and files
- Updated external tool handling classes for cross-platform compatibility
- Created dependencies directory structure for Windows builds
- Created build automation script for cross-platform builds
- Set up CI/CD for Windows builds using GitHub Actions
- Fixed GitHub Actions workflow by removing incorrect Qt module specifications
- Created a guide for cross-compiling from Linux to Windows
- Fixed Windows build compatibility issue with Qt::ColorScheme by adding a fallback implementation for Qt 6.2.4

## Immediate Priorities
1. ✅ Update CMake configuration files
   - ✅ Modify main CMakeLists.txt
   - ✅ Update src/CMakeLists.txt
   - ✅ Update resources/CMakeLists.txt
2. ✅ Create Windows-specific resources
   - ✅ Create Windows resource directory
   - ✅ Create Windows resource file (app.rc)
   - ✅ Create Windows icon file placeholder
3. ✅ Update external tool handling for cross-platform compatibility
   - ✅ Update ExternalSoftware class to add platform-specific path handling
   - ✅ Implement platform-specific path handling in ExternalSoftware.cpp
   - ✅ Update Ghostscript and QPDF classes to use platform-specific paths
4. ✅ Create dependencies directory structure
   - ✅ Create directory structure for Windows dependencies
   - ✅ Add README for dependencies
5. ✅ Create build automation script
   - ✅ Create cross-platform build script (build.py)
   - ✅ Make the script executable
6. ✅ Set up CI/CD for Windows builds
   - ✅ Create GitHub Actions workflow for Windows builds
7. ✅ Fix GitHub Actions build issues
   - ✅ Fix Qt module specification in GitHub Actions workflow
8. ✅ Create cross-compilation guide
   - ✅ Document MXE-based cross-compilation
   - ✅ Document Docker-based cross-compilation
   - ✅ Document MinGW-based cross-compilation

## Current State
The project has completed the implementation of Windows build support. All the required changes have been made to support Windows builds, including CMake configuration updates, Windows-specific resources, external tool handling updates, dependencies directory structure, build automation script, and CI/CD configuration. The GitHub Actions workflow has been fixed to correctly specify Qt modules, and a comprehensive guide for cross-compiling from Linux to Windows has been created.

## Next Steps
1. Test the Windows build process
2. Update the actual icon file (app.ico) from the SVG source
3. Consider adding more features to the build script as needed
4. Test the cross-compilation process using the provided guide

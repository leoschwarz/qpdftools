# QPDFTools Windows Build Implementation - Active Context

## Current Work Focus
Optimizing the Windows build process and simplifying the GitHub Actions workflow.

## Recent Decisions
- Created CRCT system files to track the implementation process
- Decided to follow the detailed plan in windows_build_plan.md
- Updated CMake configuration files to support Windows builds
- Created Windows resource directory and files
- Updated external tool handling classes for cross-platform compatibility
- Created dependencies directory structure for Windows builds
- Created build automation script for cross-platform builds
- Set up CI/CD for Windows builds using GitHub Actions
- Fixed GitHub Actions workflow by removing incorrect Qt module specifications
- Created a guide for cross-compiling from Linux to Windows
- Fixed Windows build compatibility issue with Qt::ColorScheme by adding a fallback implementation for Qt 6.2.4
- Created a bash script to generate Windows icon file from SVG source
- Generated and committed Windows icon file to simplify the build process
- Simplified GitHub Actions workflow by removing ImageMagick dependency

   - ✅ Fix windeployqt error with --no-angle option
8. ✅ Create cross-compilation guide
   - ✅ Document MXE-based cross-compilation
   - ✅ Document Docker-based cross-compilation
   - ✅ Document MinGW-based cross-compilation
## Current State
The project has completed the implementation of Windows build support. All the required changes have been made to support Windows builds, including CMake configuration updates, Windows-specific resources, external tool handling updates, dependencies directory structure, build automation script, and CI/CD configuration. The GitHub Actions workflow has been fixed to correctly specify Qt modules, and a comprehensive guide for cross-compiling from Linux to Windows has been created. Additionally, a compatibility fix for Qt::ColorScheme has been implemented to ensure the Windows build works correctly with Qt 6.2.4.

We've optimized the Windows build process by creating a bash script (`generate_ico.sh`) that generates the Windows icon file (app.ico) from the SVG source. This icon file is now pre-generated and committed to the repository, which simplifies the GitHub Actions workflow by removing the need to install ImageMagick and generate the icon during the build process. This reduces build dependencies and makes the build process more reliable.

We've fixed an issue with the Windows build in GitHub Actions where the build was failing with an error related to the windeployqt tool not recognizing the `--no-angle` option. This option appears to be invalid or deprecated in the version of Qt being used in the GitHub Actions workflow (Qt 6.2.4). We've explicitly removed this option from the src/CMakeLists.txt file and added a comment explaining the removal to ensure the build succeeds in GitHub Actions.

## Next Steps
1. ✅ Fix the windeployqt error with the `--no-angle` option in GitHub Actions
2. Test the Windows build process
3. ✅ Update the actual icon file (app.ico) from the SVG source (now pre-generated and committed to repository)
4. Consider adding more features to the build script as needed
5. Test the cross-compilation process using the provided guide
